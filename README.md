# Introduction
This merged dataset was created to look for signs of rising suicide rates among various cohorts internationally and throughout the socioeconomic range. It was generated from four additional datasets that were connected by time and location.

Numerous nations, including both developing and developed nations, have had a high suicide rate for a long time. We'll start by looking at the sex suicide rate, followed by the age and generation. The rank of the suicide rate will then be plotted. Finally, we'll discover the main causes of the high suicide rate.
